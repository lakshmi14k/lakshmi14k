## Hi, I am Lakshmi!👋
**What I Do?**

I'm a data analyst who doesn't just run queries. I solve problems. Whether it's uncovering why clients aren't coming back, finding revenue hiding in plain sight, or making dashboards that executives actually open, I focus on the *so what* behind the data.
Fresh out of my Masters in Information Systems at Northeastern University, I've spent the last few years building analytics systems at Fidelity Investments and Infosys, working with everything from credit card portfolios to cloud data pipelines.

**My Approach:**
- **Ask better questions:** Most analytics fail because they answer the wrong question really well. I start by understanding what decision needs to be made, then build backward from there.
- **Make it fast:** Slow queries kill momentum. I optimize for performance because insights only matter if they arrive in time.
- **Show, don't tell:** Nobody reads 50-row tables. I build visualizations that tell the story in seconds.

**What I'm Working On:**

Right now, I'm building a portfolio that shows how I think and not just what I know. You'll find projects on client retention, operational efficiency, and data modeling that would actually ship in production.

**Tech I Use:**

SQL • Python • Tableau • Snowflake • Azure • dbt

(But honestly? Tools change. Problem-solving doesn't.)
